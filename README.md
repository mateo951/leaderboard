## Leaderboard ##

The project's goal is to understand how to use medium-fidelity wireframes to create a UI and strengthen our knowledge about callbacks. The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service.

Built With

- HTML, CSS, JS, ES6
- Linters, Node.js, Git, Flexbox, Webpack
